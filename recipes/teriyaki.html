        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>As the name implies, this teriyaki beef and vegetable stir-fry is easy to make and done in under 30 minutes. </p>
            <p>Tasty and perfect for a night when you need dinner in a hurry. We like to use top sirloin for stir-fry recipes since it stays so juicy. Serve with rice or noodles.</p>

                <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
