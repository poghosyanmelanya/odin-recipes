        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This better-than-delivery homemade pizza is topped with arugula, green onions, and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. Perfect for a Friday night at home by the fire with a glass of wine!</p>
            <p>Creamy ricotta cheese, savory bacon, and spicy red pepper flakes complement the fresh produce beautifully atop a store-bought thin pizza crust. It's on the table in just 25 minutes.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 cups ricotta cheese</li>
                <li>4 stalks green onions, sliced diagonally</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
                <li>1 package thin pizza crust</li>
                <li>5 slices cooked bacon, crumbled</li>
                <li>Freshlu grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper</li>
                <li>1 bunch fresh arugula</li>
                <li>1 medium lemon, juiced</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Mix ricotta cheese, green onions, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl. Spread over pizza crust.</li>
                <li>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a cast iron skillet (large enough to hold the pizza crust) over medium heat. Gently place pizza crust with ricotta mixture into the skillet.</li>
                <li>Add bacon and Parmesan cheese and cook the bottom of the pizza for 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake until the top of the pizza begins to brown slightly, 7 to 8 minutes.</li>
                <li>Carefully remove from the oven. Season with salt and pepper, scatter arugula over top, then drizzle with lemon juice, in that order. Serve warm.</li>
            </ol>
