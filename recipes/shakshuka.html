        <h3>Description</h3>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>1 large diced onion</li>
                <li>half a cup fresh mushrooms</li>
                <li>1 cup diced red bell pepper</li>
                <li>1 jalapeno pepper</li>
                <li>cupin, paprika, salt, pepper, turmeric, cayenne</li>
                <li>1 can of crushed San Marzano tomaotoes</li>
                <li>6 large eggs</li>
                <li>crumbled feta cheese</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and mushrooms. Sprinkle with salt. Cook and stir until mushrooms release all of their liquid and start to brown, about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in bell peppers and jalapeno pepper. Cook and stir until peppers begin to soften up, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Season with cumin, paprika, turmeric, black pepper, and cayenne. Stir and cook to "wake up" the flavors, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Pour in crushed tomatoes and water. Adjust heat to medium and simmer uncovered until veggies are softened and sweet, stirring occasionally, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Make a depression in the sauce for each egg with a large spoon. Crack egg into a small ramekin and slide gently into each indentation; repeat with the rest of the eggs. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and cook until eggs are to your desired doneness.</li>
                <li>Top with feta cheese and parsley.</li>
            </ol>
